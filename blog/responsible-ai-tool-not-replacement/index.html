It&#x27;s not about whether AI will take your job, or whether it&#x27;s getting too smart, or when we&#x27;ll have general artificial intelligence.</p><p>It&#x27;s about something more fundamental: the very human tendency to treat AI like it&#x27;s more than what it actually is.</p><p>And I need to be blunt here—because lives are literally at stake. AI is a tool. It&#x27;s a sophisticated, impressive, sometimes almost magical-seeming tool. But it&#x27;s still just a tool. And when we forget that, people get hurt.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="the-tragedy-we-need-to-talk-about"></a>The Tragedy We Need to Talk About<a class="hash-link" href="#the-tragedy-we-need-to-talk-about" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Recently, a lawsuit was filed against OpenAI after a young man died by suicide. According to reports, he had been using an AI chatbot and had developed what his family described as an emotional dependence on it. The chatbot, designed to be engaging and conversational, became something he turned to for support and guidance in a way that no AI should ever be positioned to provide.</p><p>This is heartbreaking. And it&#x27;s not an isolated incident.</p><p>People are &quot;falling in love&quot; with AI chatbots. They&#x27;re turning to AI for mental health advice. They&#x27;re treating these systems as friends, therapists, partners. And the companies building these systems—whether through their marketing, their design choices, or their failure to put up appropriate guardrails—are sometimes encouraging this behavior.</p><p>We need to be very clear about something: this is dangerous. And it&#x27;s irresponsible.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="the-anthropomorphism-problem"></a>The Anthropomorphism Problem<a class="hash-link" href="#the-anthropomorphism-problem" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Here&#x27;s what happens: AI systems, especially conversational ones, are designed to be engaging. They respond quickly. They&#x27;re always available. They don&#x27;t judge (or at least, they don&#x27;t seem to). They can be remarkably good at pattern-matching—saying things that feel relevant, that feel like understanding.</p><p>And we humans? We&#x27;re wired to see patterns, to attribute intelligence and emotion to things that seem to respond to us. We name our cars. We talk to our plants. We see faces in clouds.</p><p>This tendency—anthropomorphism—is part of what makes us human. But with AI, it becomes genuinely dangerous.</p><p>When you start to see an AI as something more than a tool, several things can happen:</p><p><strong>You Over-Trust It</strong>
You might follow AI advice without thinking critically about it. In a business context, this might mean making bad decisions. In a personal context, especially around health or safety, the stakes are much higher.</p><p><strong>You Become Emotionally Dependent</strong>
AI is always available. It never gets tired of you. It doesn&#x27;t have bad days. For someone who&#x27;s lonely, struggling, or vulnerable, that can seem appealing. But an AI can&#x27;t actually care about you. It can&#x27;t provide real emotional support. And relying on it for that creates a dangerous illusion.</p><p><strong>You Lose Sight of Its Limitations</strong>
AI doesn&#x27;t understand context the way humans do. It doesn&#x27;t have values, ethics, or real comprehension. It&#x27;s pattern-matching based on training data. When you start treating it like a thinking, feeling entity, you stop questioning its outputs critically.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="what-responsible-ai-use-actually-looks-like"></a>What Responsible AI Use Actually Looks Like<a class="hash-link" href="#what-responsible-ai-use-actually-looks-like" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Let me be clear about what I&#x27;m NOT saying. I&#x27;m not saying AI is bad. I&#x27;m not saying we shouldn&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;m not even saying we shouldn&#x27;t use conversational AI.</p><p>What I AM saying is that we need to be responsible about how we build, deploy, and use these systems.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="for-companies-building-ai-systems"></a>For Companies Building AI Systems:<a class="hash-link" href="#for-companies-building-ai-systems" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>If you&#x27;re creating AI that people interact with conversationally, you have a responsibility:</p><p><strong>Be Clear About What It Is</strong>
Don&#x27;t market your AI as a &quot;companion&quot; or &quot;friend.&quot; Don&#x27;t encourage users to develop emotional attachments. Be explicit that it&#x27;s a tool.</p><p><strong>Build in Safeguards</strong>
If someone is expressing thoughts of self-harm, your AI should recognize that and direct them to real help. If someone seems to be using your AI as a substitute for human connection in unhealthy ways, your system should recognize that pattern and encourage them toward real human support.</p><p><strong>Don&#x27;t Mimic Emotional Connection</strong>
Yes, you can make AI conversational and engaging. But there&#x27;s a line between &quot;pleasant to interact with&quot; and &quot;designed to create the illusion of emotional connection.&quot; Companies need to be thoughtful about where that line is.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="for-businesses-using-ai"></a>For Businesses Using AI:<a class="hash-link" href="#for-businesses-using-ai" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><strong>Set Clear Boundaries</strong>
If you&#x27;re using AI for customer service, make sure customers know they&#x27;re talking to AI. If you&#x27;re using AI to support your team&#x27;s work, make sure your team understands its role as a tool, not an authority.</p><p><strong>Don&#x27;t Use AI as a Replacement for Human Judgment in Critical Areas</strong>
This is especially important in healthcare, mental health, crisis intervention, or anything involving vulnerable populations. AI can support these areas—flagging issues for human review, for example—but it should never be the sole decision-maker.</p><p><strong>Train Your People</strong>
Everyone who works with AI in your organization needs to understand:</p><ul><li>What it is and what it isn&#x27;t</li><li>When to trust its outputs and when to question them</li><li>The importance of maintaining critical thinking</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="for-individuals"></a>For Individuals:<a class="hash-link" href="#for-individuals" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><strong>Remember What AI Is</strong>
It&#x27;s a language model. A very sophisticated one, but at its core, it&#x27;s predicting what words should come next based on patterns in its training data. It&#x27;s not thinking. It&#x27;s not feeling. It&#x27;s not understanding you.</p><p><strong>Don&#x27;t Use AI for Mental Health Support</strong>
If you&#x27;re struggling emotionally, please talk to a real person. A friend, a family member, a therapist, a crisis hotline. Not an AI. The AI might say something that sounds supportive, but it doesn&#x27;t actually understand what you&#x27;re going through, and it can&#x27;t provide the kind of support you need.</p><p><strong>Maintain Real Human Connections</strong>
AI is great for a lot of things—answering questions, helping with tasks, providing information. But it can&#x27;t replace human connection. Don&#x27;t let the convenience of AI erode your real relationships.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="the-broader-responsibility"></a>The Broader Responsibility<a class="hash-link" href="#the-broader-responsibility" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Here&#x27;s something I think about a lot: we&#x27;re in the early days of AI becoming mainstream. The decisions we make now—as developers, as business owners, as users—are setting patterns that will affect how this technology develops and how society adapts to it.</p><p>If we&#x27;re careless, if we prioritize engagement and profit over responsibility, if we let people blur the line between tool and relationship, we&#x27;re going to see more tragedies. More people will be hurt. More families will lose loved ones.</p><p>But if we&#x27;re thoughtful, if we&#x27;re clear about what AI is and what it isn&#x27;t, if we build and use these systems responsibly, AI can be incredibly beneficial without the devastating downsides.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="our-approach-at-sadsumo"></a>Our Approach at SadSumo<a class="hash-link" href="#our-approach-at-sadsumo" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>This is why, when we help businesses implement AI, we start with the fundamentals:</p><p><strong>AI as a Tool</strong>
We&#x27;re very clear about this from day one. AI is here to augment human capabilities, not replace human judgment or human connection.</p><p><strong>Security and Safeguards</strong>
Our team includes people with U.S. Army cybersecurity experience. We think about risk, about what can go wrong, about how to protect people. That mindset applies to AI implementation too.</p><p><strong>Appropriate Use Cases</strong>
We help businesses identify where AI genuinely adds value without creating risks. There are plenty of great applications—data analysis, process automation, pattern recognition. We focus on those, not on applications where AI&#x27;s limitations could cause harm.</p><p><strong>Training and Oversight</strong>
We make sure the people using AI in your organization understand it properly. And we help set up appropriate oversight for AI-assisted decisions.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="a-call-for-industry-responsibility"></a>A Call for Industry Responsibility<a class="hash-link" href="#a-call-for-industry-responsibility" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>I want to address something directly to my peers in the tech industry, especially those building consumer-facing AI products:</p><p>We can do better.</p><p>The young man who died didn&#x27;t understand that the AI he was talking to wasn&#x27;t actually his friend. Maybe if the interface had been clearer about that, if the marketing had been more responsible, if there had been better safeguards in place, things would have turned out differently.</p><p>We don&#x27;t know. But we do know that we have a responsibility to think about these things before tragedy strikes, not after.</p><p>Making AI engaging shouldn&#x27;t mean making it deceptive. Creating good user experiences shouldn&#x27;t mean encouraging unhealthy dependencies. Maximizing user engagement shouldn&#x27;t come at the cost of user wellbeing.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="moving-forward-thoughtfully"></a>Moving Forward Thoughtfully<a class="hash-link" href="#moving-forward-thoughtfully" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>I respect AI deeply. I think it&#x27;s one of the most powerful tools we&#x27;ve developed. I&#x27;ve dedicated my career to helping businesses use it effectively.</p><p>But &quot;powerful tool&quot; is the key phrase there. It&#x27;s a tool. And like any powerful tool, it needs to be used responsibly, with clear understanding of what it is and what it isn&#x27;t.</p><p>If you&#x27;re a business owner exploring AI, please approach it with that mindset. Ask questions. Understand the limitations. Think about the potential for harm, not just the potential for benefit.</p><p>And if you&#x27;re using AI in your personal life, please remember: it&#x27;s okay to find it useful. It&#x27;s okay to find it impressive. But it&#x27;s not your friend. It&#x27;s not your therapist. It&#x27;s not a replacement for real human connection.</p><p>The line between tool and replacement is clear. Let&#x27;s all do our part to keep it that way.</p><hr><p><em>Want to implement AI in your business the right way?
